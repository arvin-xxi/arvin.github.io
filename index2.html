						<h2>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp; Just a normal boy who fell in love with coding in his early age.
							 he started to make his own toys but he felt limited by his abilities
							  so he decided to get updated but he didnt knew any programming languages
							   for that he decided to join Computer science Engineering by selling his poor organs just to get a degree :( on the time of his final exams a nasty virus named 'COVID-19' have been reported and immediately all the remaining exams were posponded and here he is now writing this whole shit for nothing :( anyways i enjoy problem solving and coding i always strive to bring 100% to the work i do. i am passionate about developing complex applications that solve real world problems impacting millions of users &nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;</h2>
